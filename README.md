# small graphics assignment

i'm learning computer graphics and we were made to draw lines using various line-drawing algorithms (who knew they didn't just like, calculate it for each and every point and show it)

i used rust so that i might ~~make the most unreadable code known to man and punish the lecturer~~ be blazingly fast ðŸš€

also it's rainbow coloured because that's as much fun i could get out of it (i considered making the _background_ rainbow but it was too much)

## keybinds

- `<Space>` to toggle between the two graphs we had to draw.

- `<G>` to toggle gridlines on and off.
